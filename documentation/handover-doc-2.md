# Saligao Adventures Game - Development Handover Document

## Current Implementation Status

### Core Game Structure
- Built with Phaser 3, React, and Material UI
- Auto-running platformer style game
- Single continuous level with infinite scrolling background
- Jump mechanics for obstacle avoidance

### Current Features
1. **Player Mechanics**
   - Auto-running with constant speed (300)
   - Jump ability (-800 velocity)
   - Collision detection with platform and obstacles
   - Player sprite flipped horizontally

2. **Background System**
   - Gradient background (sky to ground)
   - Scrolling tree sprites with parallax effect
   - Trees positioned and scaled randomly

3. **Obstacle System**
   - Bouncing frog obstacles
   - Warning system before frog appearance
   - Random spawn positions and heights

4. **UI Elements**
   - Distance score counter
   - Game over screen
   - Restart functionality

## Critical Issues to Fix

1. **Background Persistence**
   - Issue: Trees don't reload properly on game restart
   - Solution: Move tree creation to a separate method and ensure proper cleanup/recreation during restart
   - Consider using scene transitions instead of direct restart

2. **Game Mechanics Balance**
   - Issue: Current frog patterns make game too difficult
   - Suggested improvements:
     * Reduce frog bounce height
     * Increase warning time
     * Add patterns/rhythm to spawning
     * Create clear "safe zones" between obstacles
     * Consider adding power-ups or special abilities

## Next Development Phase Recommendations

1. **Gameplay Improvements**
   - Add difficulty progression
   - Implement proper level design with planned obstacle patterns
   - Add collectibles for bonus points
   - Consider adding double-jump or slide mechanics
   - Implement checkpoints

2. **Visual Enhancements**
   - Add cloud layer to background
   - Implement proper sprite animations
   - Add particle effects for jumps/collisions
   - Improve warning indicators
   - Add visual feedback for successful jumps

3. **Sound & Music**
   - Background music
   - Jump sound effects
   - Collision sounds
   - Warning sound for obstacles

4. **UI/UX Improvements**
   - Add pause functionality
   - Implement proper game over screen
   - Add high score system
   - Tutorial overlay for first play

## Asset Requirements

1. **Graphics**
   - Background elements (clouds, mountains)
   - Player animation sprites
   - Improved obstacle designs
   - UI elements and icons
   - All sprites should be PNG format
   - Recommended sizes:
     * Background elements: 1920x1080
     * Character sprites: 256x256
     * Obstacles: 128x128

2. **Audio**
   - Background music track
   - Sound effects (jump, collision, warning)
   - Victory/defeat jingles

## Code Structure Recommendations

1. **Scene Organization**
   - Separate methods for different game systems
   - Clear state management
   - Better event handling
   - Improved physics configuration

2. **Configuration**
   - Move magic numbers to config file
   - Create difficulty settings
   - Separate asset loading
   - Define level patterns

## Suggested Next Steps

1. Immediate Fixes:
   ```javascript
   // Fix tree reloading
   destroy() {
     this.backgroundTrees.forEach(tree => tree.destroy());
     this.backgroundTrees = [];
   }
   
   // Improve obstacle patterns
   spawnObstacle() {
     // Add pattern-based spawning
     // Include safe zones
     // Longer warning time
   }
   ```

2. Medium-term:
   - Implement proper level design system
   - Add progression mechanics
   - Improve visual feedback
   - Add sound system

3. Long-term:
   - Add multiple characters
   - Implement power-up system
   - Add social features
   - Create level editor

## Testing Requirements
- Physics collision testing
- Performance testing for background scrolling
- Mobile device compatibility
- Different screen size testing

## Known Working Elements
- Basic physics implementation
- Background scrolling system
- Score tracking
- Basic obstacle system

## Current Configuration Values
- Player run speed: 300
- Jump velocity: -800
- Gravity: 2000
- Level width: 3200
- Ground position: window.innerHeight - 40
- Tree spacing: 400px
- Obstacle spawn delay: 2000ms
