# Saligao Adventures Game - Development Handover Document

## Project Overview
A 2D platformer game built with React, Phaser 3, and Material UI featuring:
- Character selection system
- Platform-based gameplay
- Obstacle avoidance
- Goal-based level completion

## Current Stack
- React (Frontend framework)
- Phaser 3 (Game engine)
- Material UI (UI components)
- React Router (Navigation)

## Current Issues to Fix
1. **Physics Issues**
   - Player falls through platforms
   - Goal object doesn't maintain position
   - Obstacles not displaying

2. **Asset Loading**
   - Asset paths need verification
   - SVG compatibility needs checking
   - Static object positioning needs adjustment

## Core Components

### 1. Main Menu
- Clean Material UI interface
- Navigation to character select and game
- Leaderboard option (not implemented)

### 2. Character Selection
- Grid layout of character cards
- Character preview images
- Special abilities display (not implemented)

### 3. Game Scene
- Phaser game instance
- Platform-based level design
- Character movement system
- Goal and obstacle system

## Game Mechanics

### Current Implementation
- Left/Right movement
- Jump mechanics
- Platform collision
- Goal detection (needs fixing)
- Obstacle collision (needs fixing)

### Physics Configuration
```javascript
physics: {
    default: 'arcade',
    arcade: {
        gravity: { y: 300 },
        debug: true
    }
}
```

## Asset Structure
```
public/src/assets/
├── sprites/
    ├── placeholder-character.png
    ├── platform.png
    ├── goal.svg
    └── obstacle.svg
```

## Next Development Steps
1. Fix current issues:
   - Adjust platform collision detection
   - Fix goal object physics
   - Debug obstacle display and collision
2. Implement basic features:
   - Level design system
   - Character animations
   - Sound effects
3. Add gameplay elements:
   - Score system
   - Multiple levels
   - Character abilities

## Known Working Elements
- Material UI menu system
- Basic character movement
- Platform creation
- Game scene initialization

## Suggested Next Steps
1. Implement proper static body physics for platforms
2. Convert SVG assets to PNG for better Phaser compatibility
3. Add proper spawn points for player and objects
4. Implement proper collision groups
5. Add basic animations for character movement

## Current Game Configuration
- Canvas size: 800x600
- Physics engine: Arcade
- Debug mode: Enabled
- Gravity: 300
