# Saligao Adventures Game - Development Status & Next Steps

## Current Implementation Status

### Core Game Architecture
- Built with Phaser 3.60, React, and Material UI
- Traditional platformer mechanics (like Super Mario)
- Firebase integration for deployment
- Scene-based structure with Boot, Preload, and Game scenes

### Current Features
1. **Player Mechanics**
   - Acceleration-based movement using arrow keys
   - Variable jump height system (JUMP_VELOCITY: -600)
   - Gravity physics (gravity: 1000)
   - Character flipping based on movement direction
   - Collision detection with platforms and obstacles

2. **Level Design**
   - Static ground platform
   - Multiple elevated platforms
   - Background parallax with scrolling trees
   - Gradient background (sky to ground)
   - Level width: 3200 pixels

3. **Game Elements**
   - Score tracking system
   - Goal/finish point
   - Enemy system (frogs)
   - Coin collection system with particle effects
   - Character selection screen (UI only)

4. **Technical Implementation**
   - Proper depth layering (0-5)
   - Scene management
   - Camera system with deadzone
   - Asset preloading
   - Physics constants tuned for platformer feel

## Current Issues to Address

### Immediate Fixes Needed
1. **Player Spawn and Platform Alignment**
   - Player doesn't start aligned with ground platform
   - Current spawn position needs adjustment
   - Ground collision may need recalibration

2. **Enemy Sizing**
   - Frog enemies are too large
   - Current scale: 0.15
   - Recommended to reduce to ~0.1 or smaller
   - Need to adjust collision boxes accordingly

3. **Jump Mechanics**
   - Jump not functioning correctly
   - May be related to ground collision detection
   - Check JUMP_VELOCITY and gravity balance
   - Verify onGround detection logic

### Physics Constants
Current values that may need adjustment:
```javascript
MOVEMENT_SPEED = 200
MAX_SPEED = 400
ACCELERATION = 1500
DRAG = 1800
JUMP_VELOCITY = -600
JUMP_HOLD_DURATION = 150
MIN_JUMP_VELOCITY = -300
```

## Next Development Steps

### Priority 1: Fix Core Mechanics
1. Fix player spawn position and ground alignment
   - Adjust spawn Y position relative to ground
   - Verify ground platform position
   - Test collision boundaries

2. Fix jump mechanics
   - Review ground collision detection
   - Test and adjust jump physics constants
   - Implement proper jump state management

3. Adjust enemy size and collision
   - Reduce frog scale
   - Adjust collision boxes
   - Test jump-over mechanics

### Priority 2: Enhance Gameplay
1. Add proper character animations
   - Idle animation
   - Run animation
   - Jump/fall animations
   - Landing animation

2. Improve enemy behavior
   - Smoother patrol movement
   - Add more enemy types
   - Improve enemy-player interactions

3. Enhance collectibles system
   - Add power-ups
   - Improve coin placement
   - Add collection sound effects

## Asset Requirements
1. **Current Assets**
   - player: placeholder-character.png
   - platform: platform.png
   - goal: goal.png
   - obstacleFrog: obstacle-frog.png
   - tree: backgrounds/tree.png
   - coin: coin.png

2. **Needed Assets**
   - Character animation sprites
   - Additional enemy types
   - Power-up sprites
   - Sound effects

## Code Structure Notes
- GameScene handles core gameplay
- Physics and collision in separate methods
- Asset loading centralized in PreloadScene
- UI components in React
- Character data in characters.js

## Suggested Prompt for Next Chat

Here's the recommended prompt for the next development session:

```
I am continuing development of the Saligao Adventures platformer game. The game is built with Phaser 3.60, React, and Material UI. I'll provide the current codebase.

Current critical issues to solve:
1. The player doesn't spawn correctly on the ground platform and cannot jump
   - Need to fix spawn position
   - Fix ground collision detection
   - Review jump mechanics
2. The frog enemies are too large
   - Need to reduce scale
   - Adjust collision boxes

Please help implement these fixes while maintaining the current game structure and enhanced mechanics (acceleration-based movement, variable jump heights, etc.).
