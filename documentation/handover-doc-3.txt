# Saligao Adventures Game - Development Status & Next Steps

## Current Implementation Status

### Core Game Architecture
- Built with Phaser 3, React, and Material UI
- Traditional platformer mechanics (like Super Mario)
- Firebase integration for deployment
- Scene-based structure with Boot, Preload, and Game scenes

### Current Features
1. **Player Mechanics**
   - Left/right movement with arrow keys (MOVEMENT_SPEED: 200)
   - Jump mechanics (JUMP_VELOCITY: -400)
   - Gravity-based physics (gravity: 1000)
   - Character flipping based on movement direction
   - Collision detection with platforms and obstacles

2. **Level Design**
   - Static ground platform
   - Multiple elevated platforms
   - Background parallax with scrolling trees
   - Gradient background (sky to ground)
   - Level width: 3200 pixels

3. **Game Elements**
   - Score tracking based on distance
   - Goal/finish point
   - Basic obstacle system
   - Character selection screen

4. **Technical Implementation**
   - Proper depth layering (0-5)
   - Scene management
   - Camera system with deadzone
   - Asset preloading
   - Proper build configuration for assets

## Priority Development Areas

1. **Core Gameplay Enhancement**
   - Add proper character animations (idle, run, jump)
   - Implement variable jump heights based on button hold
   - Add acceleration/deceleration to movement
   - Consider adding wall jump or double jump mechanics
   - Add crouching and sliding mechanics

2. **Level Design System**
   - Create proper level design tools/format
   - Add different types of platforms:
     * Moving platforms
     * Disappearing platforms
     * Bouncy platforms
   - Add environmental hazards
   - Design proper level progression

3. **Enemy System**
   - Basic enemy types with different behaviors:
     * Patrolling enemies
     * Flying enemies
     * Jumping enemies
   - Enemy interaction mechanics
   - Enemy spawning system

4. **Collectibles System**
   - Add coins/gems for scoring
   - Implement power-ups:
     * Speed boost
     * Jump boost
     * Temporary invincibility
   - Add collection effects and sounds

## Technical Debt & Issues to Address
1. Fix any remaining asset bundling issues
2. Implement proper state management for game progression
3. Add proper sound system
4. Optimize performance for mobile devices

## Character System Expansion
1. Add more character options with unique abilities
2. Implement character unlocking system
3. Add character-specific animations and effects
4. Consider adding character progression/upgrades

## Next Immediate Steps
1. Implement proper character animations
2. Add basic enemy types
3. Design first complete level
4. Add coin collection system
5. Implement proper game audio

## Code Structure Notes
- GameScene handles core gameplay
- Character data in characters.js
- Asset preloading in PreloadScene
- Main game config in game.config.js

## Build & Deployment
- Using Vite for bundling
- Firebase hosting
- Assets must be properly imported in components
- Build command: npm run build
- Deploy command: firebase deploy

## Known Issues
1. Asset bundling in production needs proper configuration
2. Tree backgrounds need proper cleanup on scene restart
3. Platform collisions might need fine-tuning

## Suggested Development Order
1. First implement proper player movement physics with acceleration
2. Add basic enemy type (patrolling ground enemy)
3. Add coin collection system
4. Implement level design tools
5. Create first complete level with all elements
